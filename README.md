# RailRunner
A Modular, Scaleable, Open Source, Linear Motion Guide System

The intention of this project is to develop and share a modular and scaleable approach to linear motion. Where rigidity of linear control systems are relative to the intent of the application, a modular, scaleable design should provide a simple robust means of achieving the system integrator's intent. 

Meaning? You should be able to use the building blocks presented in this toolset to build what ever kind of linear control system you want and have it work the way you intend it to with the performance you intend it to have.

  Currently the tool set includes 
  
  Bearing Block (Rail Runner) - a configurable linear bearing block designed to be 3D printed or injection molded. It's design allows it to be used with normally available, cost effective, square or rectangular structural tubing rather than very expensive linear motion rails.

  Drive Shaft Idler - a 3D printable or machineable pressfit bearing block which fits inside square tubing allowing for parallel drive of belt or chain actuated linear motion systems.
