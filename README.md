A Modular, Scaleable, Open Source, Light Industrial Machine Development Kit

The intention of this project is to develop a modular and scaleable set of building blocks for the construction of machines for use in light manufacturing. Where rigidity of linear control systems are relative to the intent of the application, a modular, scaleable design should provide a simple robust means of achieving the system integrator's intent. 

Meaning? You should be able to use the building blocks presented in this toolset to build what ever kind of light industrial process you may want and have it work the way you intend it to with the performance you intend it to have.

  Currently the tool set includes 
  
 Large Linear Bearing Block (Rail Runner) - a configurable linear bearing block designed to be 3D printed or injection molded. It's design allows it to be used with normally available, cost effective, square or rectangular structural tubing rather than very expensive linear motion rails.

 Small Linear Bearing Blocks (Pelican Printer) - a set of components used in the construction of small low latency linear motion systems such as those used in CNC Mills and 3D Printers. These components allow for customization of NC motion control systems.

  Drive Shaft Idler - a 3D printable or machineable pressfit bearing block which fits inside standard square tubing allowing for parallel drive of belt or chain actuated linear motion systems.
